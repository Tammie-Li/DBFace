# DBFace 
DBFace is a real-time, single-stage detector for face detection, with faster speed and higher accuracy

#Version requirements
python ==3.6

pyqt == 5.12

opencv-python == 4.0.1.24

QtAwesome == 0.7.2

torchvision==0.7.0
# Our work

We use the DBFace model proposed by DeepBlue Technology to build a face recognition platform.

The GUI part is developed by Pyqt5
